## A note on linters

Make sure you have ESLint installed and enabled in VSCode:

ESLint configuration was taken from here: [Add Eslint Support to your React Native Project + React Hooks Rules](https://medium.com/swlh/add-eslint-support-to-your-react-native-project-with-react-hooks-1bbac3fac25d). Additionally, the basic prettier configs have been added.
