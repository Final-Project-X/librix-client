## A note on linters

Make sure you have ESLint installed and enabled in VSCode:

`Code => Preferences => Extentions => ESLint`

ESLint configuration from react-native-community:

`npm install eslint @react-native-community/eslint-config --save-dev`

Config files:

```javascript
// .eslintrc.js

module.exports = {
  root: true,
  extends: '@react-native-community',
};
```

```javascript
// .prettierrc.js

module.exports = {
  bracketSpacing: true,
  singleQuote: true,
  trailingComma: 'all',
};
```

A script in `package.json`:

`"lint": "eslint ."`
